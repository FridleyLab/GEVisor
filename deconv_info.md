## **Module 3: Spatial Deconvolution (SpatialDecon)**

In this module, the method [SpatialDecon](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpatialDecon.html) is applied to the data set. The cell profile matrix used is the SafeTME matrix,
included in the SpatialDecon package. Next, pie plots are shown representing each ROI.
Cell types with low proportion in the ROI (0.1) are not plotted.
